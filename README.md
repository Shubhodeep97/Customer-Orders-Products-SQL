# SQL_Project : Analysis of Orders placed by Customers for Products


In this project, I aim to use SQL to explore a dummy database consisting of three tables: Customers, Orders, and Products, in order to answer relevant realistic questions.

The store sells products to various customers and randomly generates tables with their information.
